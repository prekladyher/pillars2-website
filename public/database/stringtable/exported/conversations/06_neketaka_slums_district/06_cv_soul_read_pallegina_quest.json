Her mouth is open, milky eyes staring, frozen in shock.\r\n\r\nDressed in Pr√≠ncipi leathers, she appears to have been a pirate. A small, intricate bronze and adra device lies next to her hand, cracked and blackened.\r\n\r\nHer soul lingers close by. Even without reaching out to it, you can sense her confusion.",

The old man hardly seems like a threat, but you trust the captain's judgment.\r\n\r\nThe animancer didn't want to go, put up as much of a fight as he could. Naudra said to give him a whack, so you gave him a whack.\r\n\r\nThat shut him up, but carrying the old sack of bones is tiring. Just need to get him on the ship and you can get some rest.",

Still, you didn't think a wiry old animancer could squirm so much.\n\n\"Per complanca! Per complancanet!\" he yells out to no one in particular. It's Delver's Row, so no one particularly cares.",

I'll take that if you don't mind. <i>And especially if you do!</i> You laugh to yourself as you reach for it.\r\n\r\nThe old man starts to stammer, \"No, d-d-d... \"\r\n\r\nThere's a flash and a powerful stench, like brimstone. And a sharp pain - sharp but quickly gone. No matter.",
